# HGDMoE_SC2025

This repository contains the code implementation for the AD of SC2025.

## Description

The project provides the source code for the Adaptive Dynamic scheduling and expert routing logic, designed for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. It was developed as part of the SC2025 submission.

## Purpose

This repository demonstrates:
- Dynamic step size regulation in MoE models
- Hybrid gating mechanisms
- Proactive expert prefetching and memory-efficient routing
